A full-stack web app to facilitate voting.

##To do shortlist:
###Greater Priority
- Add private/public option when creating polls so polls can be optionally viewed only with a link and are not displayed for all to see
- Poll creator can add more options when creating polls
  - Support for this is already implemented in option handling, just need to add specific functionality
- Poll creator can see poll result metadata

###Lesser Priority
- Optimize View information displayed
- Add styles
